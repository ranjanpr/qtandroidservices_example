# Simple project that should demonstrate how Qt Android Services (Qt5.7) works #

## What have I done ##
* Created a custom activity (MyCustomAppActivity.java)
* Created a custom service (MyCustomAppService.java)
* Changed AndroidManifest.xml so that the custom activity/service gets used
* Changed AndroidManifest.xml and enabled background_running for service
* used "android.app.arguments" in AndroidManifest.xml to distuingish between Service and Application

## What's not working yet ##
~~* the onCreate() of my custom activity gets called (I added a log message and can see the log message also in my logs). 
  In the onCreate() of my custom activity I start my custom service. However my custom service gets never created (I put a log message in the onCreate
  of my custom service and that one gets never printed out).~~ It looks like that the debugger isn't aware of the newly created service (because it's following the main application) and therefore the debug messages aren't showing up. This means, that this example is actually working! If you want to confirm that this example is also working on your smartphone, open "settings" on your Android smartphone and go to the "running applications" tab. There you should see an entry for qtandroidservices_example (Application + service)
  
## Useful commands ##
*  adb root
*  adb shell stop
*  adb shell setprop log.redirect-stdio true
*  adb shell start
